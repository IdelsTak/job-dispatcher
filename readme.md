# Job Dispatcher System

This is a sample job dispatcher system implemented in Java using the largest round-robin scheduling algorithm. The system allows multiple jobs to be processed in a time-shared manner with a fixed time quantum.

## Installation

To run the job dispatcher system, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Any Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans) or a text editor

Once you have installed the required software, you can follow the steps below to run the system:

1. Open the project in your Java IDE or text editor.
2. Run the `JobDispatcher.java` file.

## Usage

When you run the `JobDispatcher.java` file, the system will create a queue of jobs and process them using the largest round-robin scheduling algorithm. The jobs are defined using the `Job` class, which has the following attributes:

- ID: the unique identifier of the job.
- Arrival Time: the time when the job arrives in the system.
- Burst Time: the time required by the job to complete.
- Priority: the priority of the job.
- Turnaround Time: the time taken by the system to complete the job.

The `Job` class also has getter and setter methods for each attribute.

The `JobDispatcher.java` file contains the main method that creates a queue of jobs, processes them using the `processJobs()` method, and prints the statistics of the jobs using the `printJobStats()` method. The `processJobs()` method implements the largest round-robin scheduling algorithm and calculates the turnaround time of each job. The `printJobStats()` method prints the statistics of the jobs in the queue, including their ID, arrival time, burst time, priority, and turnaround time.
